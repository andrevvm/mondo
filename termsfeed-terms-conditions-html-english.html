<h2>Payments, cancellations, and buyers remorse</h2>

<p>
When you register for a "Subscription Package", you consent to get access to MONDO Services immediately. You may change your mind for any or no reason and receive a full refund of all monies paid within fourteen (14) days starting from the day of your first payment for the relevant service (the “Buyers Remorse Period”). Refunds will not, however, be provided if you have already requested and recieved any services from MONDO LTD during the Buyers Remorse Period.

<p>Your payment to MONDO will automatically renew at the end of the subscription period. A "Subscription Minimum" is in effect for 1 year (12 consecutive billing cycles) of completed payments, and Services cannot be terminated within this time frame.</p>

MONDO may change the price for the Paid Subscriptions from time to time, and will communicate any price changes to you in advance and, if applicable, how to accept those changes. Price changes for Paid Subscriptions will take effect (i) if the Subscription Minimum has not been reached, at the end of the Subscription Minimum, or (ii) at start of the next subscription period following the date of the price change. As permitted by local law, you accept the new price by continuing to use the MONDO Service after the price change takes effect.

<h2>Term and termination</h2>

<p>
  The Agreements will continue to apply to you until terminated by either you or MONDO. MONDO may terminate the Agreements or suspend your access to the Service at any time for non-compliance with the Agreements. If you or MONDO terminate the Agreements, you agree that MONDO shall have no liability or responsibility to you and MONDO will not refund any amounts that you have already paid, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law. This section will be enforced to the extent permissible by applicable law.
</p>

<p>
  You may terminate the agreements with MONDO after Subscription Minimum of completed payments. Upon termination, your website will be taken offline at the end of the current paid billing cycle. Backup files will be retained up to 6 months, and restored upon request with the purchase of a new package.
